" One day, a "personality" prince by name of "prince.name" did journey from a far-off land to visit "princess.name". The twain did spend the whole day exploring the "princess.location" and acquainting themselves with each other."

" As the sun did set in the sky, "prince.name" did humbly beseech "princess.name" to become his bride. She, with much joy in her heart, did accept his suit, and they did begin the planning of their dream wedding."
